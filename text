Collaborative Filtering :

Approach 1: - User to User Collaborative Filtering
  Find a Similar user and recommend movies that they like

Approach 2: - Item to Item Collaborative Filtering
  Find similar movies based on ratings given by other users
This is a better approach because:
    1. Usually there are more users than the no of products
    2. User preferences are dynamic
